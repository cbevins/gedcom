		<p>A lot of people are interested in exploring their family genealogy
			to see if they have any celebrity or famous relatives,
			or if they are descended royalty and own any castles.
		</p>
		<p>
			My initial motiviation was to discover where the <Surname name='Bevins' /> surname originated.
			It seems to be a fairly uncommon surname in the United States, and there are conflicting
			statements whether it is English or Welsh.
			(The answer for our Bevins name, <a href="/bevins-heddens">is here</a>.)
		</p>
		<p>
			My second motiviating factor was to discover where my direct ancestors
			came from.  I had heard various ratios of English, Norwegian, Irish,
			Scottish, German, etc, but wanted a more quantitative answer.
		</p>
		<p>
			But once I started exploring the question of <em>where</em> my
			grand parents came from, the obvious question arises of <em>why</em>
			did they leave their ancestoral homeland to undertake a dangerous
			sea crossing onto an unexplored continent?  Were they driven here
			by political and economic forces?  Or were they adventurers
			seeking their fortunes in a New World?
		</p>
		<p>
			So while I have always been interested in history,
			exploring my family genealogy offers a personal perspective
			on how historical events impacted my direct ancestors,
			thereby determining who I am and how I got here.
			It is also a great way to understand on a personal scale
			the important political, economic, and religious events
			that seemed so remote in school text books.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, finding a unique way to present my research results
			allows me to keep my web development skills sharp and current.
