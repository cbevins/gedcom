            William Longford Bevins (1815-1889) [2nd GGF, #16]
        </div>
        <p>
            William Longford Bevins was born Mar 4 1815 in Newbold Verdon, Leicestershire, England.
            He was the son of John Bevins (1783-1863) [3rd GGP, #32] and
            Sara Ann Longford (1795-1861) [3rd GGM, #33].
        </p>
        <p>
            The Bevins' pedigree goes back at least 4 more
            generations in the New Verdon and Leicestershire:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    John Bevins [3rd GGF, #32] was the son
                    of Joseph Bevins (1762-1832) and Mary Isom (1766-?).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Joseph [4th GGF, #64] was the son of Thomas Bevins (1731-?) and Sarah Wrathburn (1740-?).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Thomas [5th GGF, #128] was the son of William Bevins (1705-?) and Sarah Wilkinson (1696-?).
                </li>
                <li>
                    William [6th GGF, #256] was the son of (unknown) Bevins (1646-?) and an unknown spouse.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                William Longford first married Ruth Gent (1817-1838)
                on Nov 13, 1837 in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire.
                She gave birth to a son, John Henry Bevins on Mar 19 1938 in Ashby de la Zouch, Leicestershire.
                It seems likely that Ruth Gent may have died during or shortly after childbirth.
            </p>
            <p>He subsequently married Mary Bolt (1822-1878) and had 11 nore children.</p>
            <p>He died Feb 13 1935 in Otter Tail, MN.</p>

        <p>
            Mary Bolt/Bott/Both was born Aug 19, 1882 in Barwell, Leicestershire, England
            to Simon Bolt/Bott (1779-1854) [3rd GGF, #34] of Stanton under Bardon, Leicestershire,

                    The first mention of Newbold Verdon is in the Domesday Book (1086),
                or "Great Survey", commissioned by William the Conquerer to inventory
                his newly won kingdom.
                It was originally an agricultural center that grew in size in the 1850s
                with the expansion of coal mining in the area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Is it possible that farmers like the Bevins sold their land
                    or had it siezed for mining?  Perhaps more likely,
                    after several generations of large families,
                    there was little land left to divvy up among the sons
                    and the latter-born had to look elsewhere.
                    They could have stayed in Leicestershire and become miners,
                    but instead chose to remain farmers by emigrating to the US.

                <p>
                    A lot of Bevins must have left England about the same time.

            William Longford Bevins, his wife Mary Bolt, and sons John, Joseph,
            and William Alfred emigrated from Liverpool, England,
            arriving in New York on August 21, 1854.
        </p>
        <p>
        They sailed on the Collins Line ship <class id="shipname">Baltic</class>
        (2856 tons, 3 masts, 1 funnel).

        <p>
            Within a year of arriving in New York, the Bevins-Bolt family had removed to
            Newark NJ for the birth of Sarah Anne in Aug 9, 1845.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 1850 US Census places the family as farmers in Townsend, Huron, OH.    
            Sarah Anne's obituary says the family stayed in Ohio until she was 10 (1855),
            then removed again to Henry Co, IL,
            while her 50th anniversary article says she moved to Henry Co, IL in 1858.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 1860, 1870, 1880, and 1890 US Census all place William Longford Bevins
            as a farmer in Annawan, Henry, IL

            William Alfred Bevins (1815-1889) [1st GGF, #8]
            was born Jun 12 1843 in Leicester, Leicestershire, UK.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mary Ann White (1848-1922) [1st GGM]
            was born July 10 1848 in Torquey, Devon, UK to
            Thomas White(1830-1880) and Jane Oliver (1829-1875)
            both of whom died in the UK.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mary Ann had a daughter, Mary Alice, on Oct 24 1871 in England.
            Whether the father was prior to William Alfred,
            or William Alfred returned to England to meet her, is unknown.
            According to Mary Alice's obituary, she "came to Illinois with her father in 1871 at age one"
            (see also 1910 USC).
            Mary Ann then married William Alfred in 1874 in Annawan, Henry, IL.
            Mary Ann gave birth to the following children:
            <ol>
                <li>Mary Alice Bevins [Isrealson, Hartgrove]: born Oct 24 1871, England: died May 5 1937, Wadena, MN.</li>
