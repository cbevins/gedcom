### 1 - Alfred Cartwright and Mary Ann Nelson are probably NOT Laura's Parents

Many Ancestry trees give Alfred Cartwright (1821-1893) and Mary Ann Nelson (1828-1869) as Laura's parents; but this contradicts the names given in the 1860 and 1870 USFC.

Alfred Carwright was born 1821 in Cayuga, NY and died 1893 in Atwwod, Kosciusko, IN, so these years and locations are plausible with the 1860 and 1870 USFC, although his name is not.

Mary Ann Nelson was born 1828 in Somerset, Somerset, PN, so her name and birthplace both contradict the USFC (but she did die in 1869 in Marshall, IN).

Also their children's names in the 1870 USFC are William (22), Francis (18), Oscar (14), Martin (7), Walter (5), and Urias (3), which is *very* different, except for the 2 Francis who are about the same age.

### 2 - Joseph Crtwright and Abigal Josephine Maria Catt MAY BE Laura's Parents
